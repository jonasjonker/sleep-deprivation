From our analysis on the effect of sleep deprivation on the reaction time of long distance truck drivers, we concluded that the reaction
 time of people before they were sleep deprived averages 251.41 ms (sd = 24.74). There is a significant positive correlation between 
the amount of days of sleep deprivation and the reaction time. More precisely, as the sleep deprivation proceeds, 
the time needed for a driver to respond to a visual stimulus is increasing by 10.47 ms (sd = 5.92) per day.


Several groups of drivers with different conditions of restricted sleep deprivation or a control group would additionally help us draw a
 more concrete conclusion. From the existing literature, mathematical models predicting alertness from preceding sleep-wake history 
typically involve four factors, sleep homeostasis, circadian rhythm, sleep inertia and neuromodulatory changes. 
Thus, we can conclude that there is a relation between reaction time and sleep deprivation, but it is not the only factor that can fully
 describe the relationship of sleep deprivation and the reaction time.
